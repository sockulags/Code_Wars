### Overview
Welcome to my CodeWars practice repository! CodeWars is a platform where I hone my coding skills by solving programming challenges, sharpening my proficiency in both C# and JavaScript.

### What is CodeWars?
CodeWars is an online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges, known as "kata." These challenges range in difficulty and cover various programming languages. By solving kata, I can enhance my problem-solving skills, explore new concepts, and learn best practices.

### Repository Structure
Levels: 8kyu... 1kyu where lower is more difficult.
Question-name: I might solve the same question with different language, so It might be smart to sort like this.
