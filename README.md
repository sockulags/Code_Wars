## MyCodeWars Repository

### Overview
Welcome to my CodeWars practice repository! CodeWars is a platform where I hone my coding skills by solving programming challenges, sharpening my proficiency in both C# and JavaScript.

### What is CodeWars?
CodeWars is an online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges, known as "kata." These challenges range in difficulty and cover various programming languages. By solving kata, I can enhance my problem-solving skills, explore new concepts, and learn best practices
